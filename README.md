# Aviation Venture Risk EDA TODO: Working Title, come up with the official title later

TODO: Filled in mock template, based on the canvas requirements.  Compare it to the MVP (minimum viable product) example template.

## Overview
ACME Co. is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) utilizes data from the National Transportation Safety Board to determine which aircraft have the lowest risk. The analysis contains actionable insights for the head of the new Aviation Division, Scott Fly.
 
## Business Understanding
TODO: Another header image here?
- **Goal**: Recommend at least 3 actionable insights 
- **Stakeholders**: Head of the new Aviation Division, Scott Fly.
- **Key Business Questions**: TODO: Come up with the actual questions these are placeholders
  1. Which aircraft models have the lowest incident rates?
  2. What factors contribute most to aviation accidents?
  3. How do different aircraft compare in terms of safety and reliability?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
- **Source of Data**: National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident data (1962-2023).
- **Description of Data**: The dataset includes information on civil aviation accidents and incidents. TODO: Give Examples
- **Three Visualizations**: TODO: Come up with the actual visualizations after doing the EDA
  1. **Accident Frequency by Aircraft Model**: Bar chart showing the number of accidents for each aircraft model.
  2. **Causes of Accidents**: Pie chart illustrating the distribution of different causes of aviation accidents.
  3. **Trend Over Time**: Line graph depicting the trend in aviation accidents over the years.

## Conclusions
TODO: List actual conclusions

This analysis leads to three recommendations for improving operations of ACME Co.

  1. **Finding 1**: [Detailed description of the first key finding, e.g., "Aircraft model X has the lowest incident rate among the studied models."]
  2. **Finding 2**: [Detailed description of the second key finding, e.g., "Mechanical failure is the most common cause of accidents, accounting for 40% of all incidents."]
  3. **Finding 3**: [Detailed description of the third key finding, e.g., "The number of accidents has been decreasing over the past decade, indicating improvements in aviation safety."]

## Next Steps

Futher analysis could yield additional insights to further improve operations at ACME Co.

- **Build Predictive Models** Building models to predict which aircraft will be the best in terms of safety in the future.
- **Exploring Other Data Sources** Using more data sources can give us more informed decisions.
- **Live Updates** Getting the system to live update on the latest data can give us an edge over the competition.
- **Studying Others Solutions** Studying other companies and groups solutions for ideas on how to approach these challenges and how and if they can fit in for us.
